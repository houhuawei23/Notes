This script builds and installs the `libblocksruntime` library, a dependency for the `libdispatch` (also known as Grand Central Dispatch). Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

### 1. **Navigate to the Source Directory**
```bash
cd ${WDIR}/blocks-runtime/
```
- Changes the working directory to `${WDIR}/blocks-runtime/`. `${WDIR}` is likely a variable defined earlier in the environment, pointing to the base working directory.

---

### 2. **Initialize Build Tools**
```bash
libtoolize ; aclocal ; autoheader ; autoconf ; automake --add-missing
```
- This sequence prepares the build environment for the `libblocksruntime` library:
  1. **`libtoolize`**: Prepares the source tree for `libtool`, which helps manage the creation of shared and static libraries.
  2. **`aclocal`**: Generates `aclocal.m4` by gathering macro definitions, setting up the environment for `autoconf`.
  3. **`autoheader`**: Creates a template for `config.h`, used for platform-specific configuration.
  4. **`autoconf`**: Generates the `configure` script from `configure.ac`, which customizes the build process.
  5. **`automake --add-missing`**: Generates `Makefile.in` and adds any missing auxiliary files (like `install-sh` or `missing`).

These steps ensure the project is ready for a standard `./configure && make` build process.

---

### 3. **Prepare the Build Directory**
```bash
rm -rf build ; mkdir -p build ; cd build
```
- **`rm -rf build`**: Deletes any existing `build` directory, ensuring a clean slate.
- **`mkdir -p build`**: Creates a new `build` directory if it doesn’t already exist.
- **`cd build`**: Changes into the `build` directory where the actual compilation will take place.

---

### 4. **Configure the Build**
```bash
CC="${MocCC} ${MocCFLAGS} -fcommon" CXX="${MocCXX} ${MocCXXFLAGS} -fcommon" \
	../configure --prefix="${WDIR}/install/libblocksruntime" \
	--disable-shared --enable-static --with-pic
```
- Sets the **C and C++ compiler flags**:
  - `CC` and `CXX` are set to `${MocCC}` and `${MocCXX}` respectively, along with their corresponding flags (`${MocCFLAGS}` and `${MocCXXFLAGS}`), plus the `-fcommon` flag. 
    - `-fcommon` ensures variables in multiple translation units are treated as common, improving compatibility with older codebases.
- Runs the `../configure` script with the following options:
  - **`--prefix`**: Specifies the installation directory as `${WDIR}/install/libblocksruntime`.
  - **`--disable-shared`**: Disables building shared libraries.
  - **`--enable-static`**: Enables building static libraries.
  - **`--with-pic`**: Ensures position-independent code is generated, which is often required for static libraries used in shared contexts.

This step customizes the build for the specific environment.

---

### 5. **Build and Install**
```bash
make -j$(nproc) install V=1
```
- **`make -j$(nproc)`**: Compiles the source code using as many parallel jobs as there are available CPU cores (`$(nproc)`).
- **`install`**: Installs the compiled library to the directory specified by the `--prefix` option in the `configure` script.
- **`V=1`**: Ensures verbose output during the `make` process, which shows detailed compilation commands.

---

### Key Outputs
- The static version of the `libblocksruntime` library is built and installed to `${WDIR}/install/libblocksruntime`.
- Shared libraries are explicitly disabled to focus on creating static libraries for linking.

### Purpose
This script is part of setting up a dependency for a larger project, ensuring that `libblocksruntime` is built in a controlled and predictable way, customized for the environment.

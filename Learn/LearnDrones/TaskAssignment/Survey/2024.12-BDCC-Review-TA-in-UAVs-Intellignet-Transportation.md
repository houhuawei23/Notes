## Abstract 

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are being seen as the most promising type of autonomous vehicles in the context of intelligent transportation system (ITS) technology. A key enabling factor for the current development of ITS technology based on autonomous vehicles is the task allocation architecture. This approach allows tasks to be efficiently assigned to robots of a multi-agent system, taking into account both the robots’ capabilities and service requirements. Consequently, this study provides an overview of the application of drones in ITSs, focusing on the applications of task allocation algorithms for UAV networks. Currently, there are different types of algorithms that are employed for task allocation in drone-based intelligent transportation systems, including market-based approaches, game-theory-based algorithms, optimization-based algorithms, machine learning techniques, and other hybrid methodologies. This paper offers a comprehensive literature review of how such approaches are being utilized to optimize the allocation of tasks in UAV-based ITSs. The main characteristics, constraints, and limitations are detailed to highlight their advantages, current achievements, and applicability to different types of UAV-based ITSs. Current research trends in this field as well as gaps in the literature are also thoughtfully discussed.

## Introduction 介绍

The UAV task allocation problem in the context of intelligent transportation systems can be divided into four main categories. First, based on whether UAVs can perform multiple different tasks simultaneously, they are classified as either Single-Task-UAVs (S-T-UAVs) or Multi-Task-UAVs (M-T-UAVs). Second, depending on whether a task requires multi-UAVs to work together, it is categorized as either a Single-UAV-Task (S-UAV-T) or a Multi-UAV-Task (M-UAV-T). Third, depending on whether the drone task allocation is completed in real time, it can be categorized into Online-Task-Allocation (O-T-A) and Offline-Task-Allocation (OF-T-A). Fourth, based on the presence of dependencies between tasks, tasks can be divided into two types: Independent-Tasks (I-T) and Dependent-Tasks (D-T).

智能交通系统背景下的无人机任务分配问题可分为四大类。

- 首先，根据无人机是否可以同时执行多个不同的任务，将其分为单任务无人机（ST-UAV）或多任务无人机（MT-UAV）。
- 其次，根据任务是否需要多无人机协同工作，它被分类为单无人机任务（S-UAV-T）或多无人机任务（M-UAV-T）。
- 第三，根据无人机任务分配是否实时完成，可以分为在线任务分配（OTA）和离线任务分配（OF-TA）。
- 第四，根据任务之间是否存在依赖关系，任务可以分为两种类型：独立任务（IT）和依赖任务（DT）。

The two most used drones in the six task allocation models (S-UAV-T, M-UAV-T, O-T-A, OF-T-A, I-T, and D-T) mentioned above are S-T-UAV and M-T-UAV, and all six task allocation models involve several common objectives, including maximizing the total revenue of the task set, minimizing the flight distance, and minimizing the total cost of the fleet [[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B7-BDCC-08-00177)]. Some UAV task allocation issues in ITS technology are the same as those previously defined. For example, in distribution systems, due to the large-scale characteristics of some distribution problems, a fleet composed of multiple UAVs needs to cooperate to complete the set of tasks. This M-UAV-T allocation problem is defined as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) [[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B8-BDCC-08-00177)]. In small-scale delivery systems using a single UAV, the S-UAV-T allocation problem is defined as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The task allocation problem of a UAV-based ITS is a Non-deterministic Polynomial time (NP-hard) problem. In synthesis, the UAV task allocation problem is the determination of the task sequences for a single UAV or a UAV fleet based on the scope and objectives of the entire task set, thereby ensuring its smooth and efficient completion [[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B9-BDCC-08-00177)]. At the same time, for the UAV to successfully complete its mission, various constraints of both the task and the UAV need to be considered, including the payload capacity, operational speed, task due date, and the maximum flight distance of the UAV.

上述六种任务分配模型（S-UAV-T、M-UAV-T、OTA、OF-TA、IT 和 DT）中使用最多的两种无人机是 ST-UAV 和 MT-UAV，并且所有六种任务分配模型涉及几个共同目标，包括最大化任务集的总收入、最小化飞行距离以及最小化机队的总成本[ [7](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B7-BDCC-08-00177) ]。 ITS 技术中的一些无人机任务分配问题与之前定义的相同。例如，在配送系统中，由于一些配送问题的大规模特征，需要由多架无人机组成的机队协同完成一组任务。这种 M-UAV-T 分配问题被定义为车辆路径问题（VRP）[ [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B8-BDCC-08-00177) ]。在使用单个无人机的小规模配送系统中，S-UAV-T 分配问题被定义为旅行商问题（TSP）。基于无人机的智能交通系统的任务分配问题是一个非确定性多项式时间（NP-hard）问题。综上所述，无人机任务分配问题是根据整个任务集的范围和目标确定单个无人机或无人机机队的任务序列，从而确保其顺利高效地完成[ [9](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B9-BDCC-08-00177) ]。同时，为了使无人机顺利完成任务，需要考虑任务和无人机的各种约束，包括有效载荷能力、作业速度、任务到期日期和无人机的最大飞行距离。

With the rise of robotic systems technology, the concept of multi-robot task allocation has been established as a dynamic research area in the broad context of operations research applications, and some literature reviews have been recently proposed that also consider UAV-based systems [[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B7-BDCC-08-00177),[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B10-BDCC-08-00177),[11](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B11-BDCC-08-00177),[12](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B12-BDCC-08-00177)]. But, to the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks a critical survey of the application of multi-agent system (MAS)-based task allocation paradigms to a fleet of UAVs conceptualized as an intelligent transportation network. This paper presents a survey of MAS task allocation techniques and their application to drone-based networks for intelligent transportation applications. The main contributions of this work are threefold:

随着机器人系统技术的兴起，多机器人任务分配的概念已被确立为运筹学应用广泛背景下的动态研究领域，并且最近提出了一些文献综述，其中也考虑了基于无人机的系统[ [7](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B7-BDCC-08-00177) 、 [10](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B10-BDCC-08-00177) 、 [11](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B11-BDCC-08-00177) 、 [12](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B12-BDCC-08-00177) ]。但是，据我们所知，文献缺乏对基于多智能体系统（MAS）的任务分配范例在概念化为智能交通网络的无人机机队中的应用的批判性调查。本文对 MAS 任务分配技术及其在基于无人机的智能交通应用网络中的应用进行了调查。这项工作的主要贡献有三个：

#### Challenges of Task Allocation Algorithms

任务分配算法的挑战

According to the works of [[13](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B13-BDCC-08-00177),[14](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B14-BDCC-08-00177)], UAV task allocation for ITSs can mainly be divided into two categories: OF-T-A (also known as static task allocation) and O-T-A (also known as dynamic task allocation). Unlike static task allocation, dynamic task allocation typically requires the use of fewer computing resources to generate real-time solutions. Centralized algorithms and distributed algorithms are the mainstream algorithms applied to static task allocation and dynamic task allocation, respectively. Currently, algorithms used for static task allocation mainly rely on biologically inspired operators, such as genetic algorithms (GAS) [[15](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B15-BDCC-08-00177)], particle swarm optimization (PSO) approaches [[16](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B16-BDCC-08-00177)], and differential evolution (DE) algorithms [[17](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B17-BDCC-08-00177)], aiming to find approximate optimal solutions in a short period of time. After more than two decades of development, although centralized algorithms have become mature, the aspects of computational time and convergence accuracy still remain significant challenges.

根据[ [13](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B13-BDCC-08-00177) , [14](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B14-BDCC-08-00177) ]的工作，智能交通系统的无人机任务分配主要分为两类：OF-TA（也称为静态任务分配）和 OTA（也称为动态任务分配）。与静态任务分配不同，动态任务分配通常需要使用较少的计算资源来生成实时解决方案。集中式算法和分布式算法分别是应用于静态任务分配和动态任务分配的主流算法。目前，用于静态任务分配的算法主要依赖于受生物学启发的算子，例如遗传算法（GAS）[ [15](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B15-BDCC-08-00177) ]、粒子群优化（PSO）方法[ [16](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B16-BDCC-08-00177) ]和差分进化（DE）算法[ [17](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B17-BDCC-08-00177) ]，旨在在短时间内找到近似最优解。经过二十多年的发展，中心化算法虽然已经成熟，但计算时间和收敛精度方面仍然存在重大挑战。

In comparison to OF-T-A algorithms, the development of O-T-A algorithm faces other significant challenges. Firstly, real-time task allocation increases the computational demand of solution algorithms, requiring them to solve NP-hard problems with fewer computational resources. It is well known that real-time algorithms often sacrifice decision quality to ensure their real-time performance; thus, balancing decision quality and algorithmic real-time performance is also a significant challenge. In addition, the generalization capability of the task allocation algorithms poses significant challenges in the task scheduling context of UAV-based ITSs. Determining how algorithms that perform satisfactorily in small-scale networks can adapt to large-scale drone networks has also become an emerging issue for researchers. Finally, the algorithms’ robustness presents further challenges. In unexpected situations, such as the loss of control of a drone or inadequate communication network coverage, real-time algorithms should be able to make immediate decisions to ensure that the completion of the task set is not compromised. Therefore, task reallocation is also being addressed in the literature. There are different types of algorithms that are employed in state-of-the-art drone-based intelligent transportation systems, including auction (market)-based approaches, game-theory-based algorithms, optimization-based algorithms, and machine learning (ML) techniques. These approaches and their application to UAV-based ITSs are thoughtfully presented and discussed in the next sections.

与 OF-TA 算法相比，OTA 算法的发展还面临着其他重大挑战。

- 首先，实时任务分配增加了求解算法的计算需求，要求它们用更少的计算资源解决 NP 难题。众所周知，实时算法往往会牺牲决策质量来保证其实时性；因此，平衡决策质量和算法实时性能也是一个重大挑战。
- 此外，任务分配算法的泛化能力对基于无人机的 ITS 的任务调度环境提出了重大挑战。确定在小型网络中表现令人满意的算法如何适应大规模无人机网络也成为研究人员面临的一个新问题。
- 最后，算法的鲁棒性提出了进一步的挑战。在意外情况下，例如无人机失去控制或通信网络覆盖范围不足，实时算法应该能够立即做出决策，以确保任务集的完成不受影响。因此，文献中也讨论了任务重新分配。
- 最先进的基于无人机的智能交通系统采用了不同类型的算法，包括基于拍卖（市场）的方法、基于博弈论的算法、基于优化的算法和机器学习（ML） ）技术。这些方法及其在基于无人机的 ITS 中的应用将在下一节中进行深入介绍和讨论。

## Game-Theory-Based Algorithms 基于博弈论的算法

在[ 18 ]的工作中，基于博弈论的自主控制问题被定义并用几个无人机任务规划的例子来说明。基于博弈论的任务分配问题被定义为非结构化环境（随机环境）或具有敌对代理的确定性环境中的决策问题。此后，博弈论算法作为去中心化分布式 M-UAV-T 分配算法得到了广泛的研究[ 19 ]。在基于博弈论的智能交通系统无人机任务分配问题中，每架无人机被定义为能够做出决策和执行任务的“玩家”。在实际任务中，由于通信限制，玩家可能完全、部分或不了解网络中的其他无人机。在基于博弈论的 M-UAV-T 分配问题中，一组无人机被定义为 $A=\left\{1,2,3, \ldots, a_{M A X}\right\}$。对于任何无人机 $a$，对应的策略集为 $D_{a}=\left\{d_{a, 1}, d_{a, 2}, d_{a, 3}, \ldots, d_{a, n}\right\}$ 。算法结束时, 每架无人机选择的策略对应的一组无人机的收益为 $Z=\left\{z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, \ldots, z_{a_{M A X}}\right\}$ 。参与者、策略集和收益集构成了智能交通系统中多无人机任务分配博弈的三个组成部分。另外，博峦论可以分为两类模型：合作博弈和非合作博峦。

2.1.基于非合作博弈的任务分配

2.2. Cooperative Game-Based Task Allocation
2.2.基于合作博弈的任务分配

## Learning-Based Algorithms 基于学习的算法

For real-time task allocation (O-T-A), the learning-based algorithm is another good approach. Compared to traditional artificial neural networks and deep neural networks, reinforcement learning can handle complex tasks and continuously optimize strategies from the optimization process, making it widely used by researchers in real-time task allocation problems for multi-UAVs. In order to solve the M-UAV-T allocation problem, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed in [27] with the aim of improving the computational efficiency and the convergence accuracy of the task allocation algorithm. Unlike game-theory-based methods, reinforcement-learning-based algorithms typically establish a nonlinear model based on the task allocation problem, as shown in Equation (1).

对于实时任务分配（OTA），基于学习的算法是另一种好方法。与传统的人工神经网络和深度神经网络相比，强化学习可以处理复杂的任务，并从优化过程中不断优化策略，使其被研究人员广泛应用于多无人机的实时任务分配问题。为了解决 M-UAV-T 分配问题，文献[ 27 ]提出了一种深度强化学习算法，旨在提高任务分配算法的计算效率和收敛精度。与基于博弈论的方法不同，基于强化学习的算法通常基于任务分配问题建立非线性模型，如方程（1）所示。

The objective function aims to minimize the cost of the problem, which is the same as the reward function in game-based models. 𝑏≤𝐵𝑚𝑎𝑥 denotes a set of constraints considering the boundary conditions.

目标函数旨在最小化问题的成本，这与基于博弈的模型中的奖励函数相同。 𝑏≤𝐵𝑚𝑎𝑥 表示考虑边界条件的一组约束。

In addition, the work of [28] also aims at improving the convergence accuracy of the algorithm, thus developing an improved reinforcement learning algorithm. The reinforcement learning algorithm introduces the transfer learning theory. After finding a similar UAV task allocation model in the policy library, the algorithm transfers the training parameter results of the previous source task to the new model through transfer learning. The simulation results show that the algorithm not only effectively improves the performance of UAV task allocation schemes, but also has a strong generalization capability. The authors of [29] developed a multi-agent reinforcement learning method aimed at generating task allocation schemes for heterogeneous UAV fleets. This algorithm can run in locally known environments and has strong robustness.

此外，[ 28 ]的工作还旨在提高算法的收敛精度，从而开发出改进的强化学习算法。强化学习算法引入了迁移学习理论。在策略库中找到类似的无人机任务分配模型后，算法通过迁移学习将先前源任务的训练参数结果迁移到新模型中。仿真结果表明，该算法不仅有效提高了无人机任务分配方案的性能，而且具有较强的泛化能力。 [ 29 ]的作者开发了一种多智能体强化学习方法，旨在为异构无人机机队生成任务分配方案。该算法可以在本地已知的环境中运行，具有很强的鲁棒性。

## Market-Based Algorithms 基于市场的算法

Auction-based algorithms are widely used for task allocation in drone applications. These algorithms are based on economic principles, as they are alternatively called market-based algorithms, with agents using a negotiation protocol to bid in an auction for task allocation, informed by their local perception of the environment. The agents aim to complete the task assigned with the highest utility or lowest cost by bidding based on the cost or utility they calculate. According to the agents’ utility functions, a global objective function is optimized. According to [[31](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B31-BDCC-08-00177)], auction-based algorithms present several advantages, including a high solution efficiency and moderate computational costs, in addition to having a dynamic protocol, as they can include or remove new tasks from the allocation procedure.

基于拍卖的算法广泛用于无人机应用中的任务分配。这些算法基于经济原理，因为它们也称为基于市场的算法，代理使用协商协议在任务分配拍卖中竞标，并根据其对环境的本地感知进行了解。代理的目标是根据他们计算的成本或效用进行投标，以最高效用或最低成本完成分配的任务。根据智能体的效用函数，优化全局目标函数。根据[ [31](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B31-BDCC-08-00177) ]，基于拍卖的算法除了具有动态协议之外，还具有多种优势，包括高解决效率和适中的计算成本，因为它们可以在分配过程中包含或删除新任务。

The literature presents several works related to auction methodology. A time-sensitive sequential auction (TSSA) algorithm considering time window constraints is proposed in [[32](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B32-BDCC-08-00177)] for task allocation in a multi-agent system. An auction-based algorithm for multi-agent task allocation is also proposed in [[33](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B33-BDCC-08-00177)]. In this way, auction-based task allocation has received increasing attention since there are different factors that may be considered, including UAVs’ capability, battery consumption, execution time, and path routes, among others. The work of [[34](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B34-BDCC-08-00177)] proposes an auction-based algorithm for multiple UAVs. A multi-layer cost computation strategy is developed to handle multiple constraints and determine the bid’s value.

文献中介绍了一些与拍卖方法相关的著作。 [ [32](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B32-BDCC-08-00177) ]提出了一种考虑时间窗口约束的时间敏感顺序拍卖（TSSA）算法，用于多智能体系统中的任务分配。 [ [33](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B33-BDCC-08-00177) ]中还提出了一种基于拍卖的多智能体任务分配算法。这样，基于拍卖的任务分配受到了越来越多的关注，因为可以考虑不同的因素，包括无人机的能力、电池消耗、执行时间和路径路线等。 [ [34](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B34-BDCC-08-00177) ]的工作提出了一种针对多个无人机的基于拍卖的算法。开发了多层成本计算策略来处理多个约束并确定出价的价值。

Most of the proposed auction algorithms yield a poor performance for multi-dynamic tasks for multiples drones. To address this issue, a hybrid auction algorithm, based on a decision mechanism and an enhanced objective function, is proposed in [[35](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B35-BDCC-08-00177)]. The work of [[36](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B36-BDCC-08-00177)] exploits a dynamic decentralized auction-based algorithm for multi-agent systems, such as UAVs. A dynamic task allocation protocol is used, since the agent utilities may change throughout their path towards their targets. This strategy aims to assign a maximum of one task to each member of the fleet, while the same task can be allocated to multiple agents. Thus, the task utilities are calculated according to the agent’s states; i.e., they depend on both the rewards from the accomplishment of the assigned tasks and the costs associated with their execution. Differently from game-based algorithms that may not always achieve high levels of global utility, the auction-based algorithm is able to greedily achieve global utility, due to its simplicity and fast convergence.

大多数提出的拍卖算法对于多架无人机的多动态任务性能较差。为了解决这个问题，[ [35](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B35-BDCC-08-00177) ]提出了一种基于决策机制和增强目标函数的混合拍卖算法。 [ [36](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B36-BDCC-08-00177) ]的工作为多代理系统（例如无人机）开发了一种基于动态去中心化拍卖的算法。使用动态任务分配协议，因为代理实用程序可能会在其通往目标的整个路径中发生变化。该策略旨在为舰队的每个成员最多分配一项任务，而同一任务可以分配给多个代理。因此，任务效用是根据智能体的状态计算的；即，它们既取决于完成指定任务的回报，也取决于与执行任务相关的成本。与基于游戏的算法可能并不总能实现高水平的全局效用不同，基于拍卖的算法由于其简单性和快速收敛而能够贪婪地实现全局效用。

The use of different auction-based algorithms to solve a heterogenous task allocation problem for multiple UAVs in a drone delivery context is investigated in [[37](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B37-BDCC-08-00177)]. The strategy is used to minimize the battery consumption of a UAS-based parcel transportation service by allocating delivery tasks with due date constraints to multiple drones that demand a lower consumption of energy. The allocation of charge tasks is also addressed. These auction-based algorithms were implemented by means of both single-item and multiple-item strategies. Scalar constrained optimization problems are solved by each agent to calculate the UAV’s bid for each task. For delivery tasks, the protocol’s bid is related to the consumption of energy, while the flight time is chosen for charge task bids. Path planning is also included in the framework to compute the risk-aware path for each task-UAV bid by means of a 2D risk map of the operational area.

[ [37](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B37-BDCC-08-00177) ] 研究了使用不同的基于拍卖的算法来解决无人机交付环境中多个无人机的异构任务分配问题。该策略用于通过将具有到期日期限制的交付任务分配给需要较低能源消耗的多架无人机来最大限度地减少基于无人机的包裹运输服务的电池消耗。还解决了充电任务的分配问题。这些基于拍卖的算法是通过单项和多项策略来实现的。每个代理解决标量约束优化问题，以计算无人机对每个任务的出价。对于投递任务，协议的出价与能量消耗相关，而对于充电任务的出价则选择飞行时间。框架中还包含路径规划，通过操作区域的二维风险图来计算每个任务无人机投标的风险感知路径。

The work of [[38](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B38-BDCC-08-00177)] investigates the use of a second price auction algorithm for drone intelligent transportation. A deep learning methodology is also included to enhance the auction algorithm’s robustness by revenue optimality. In addition, an improved implementation of an auction algorithm for drone delivery is addressed in [[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B39-BDCC-08-00177)]. Lightweight distributed task allocation is proposed for this application, simplifying the management of delivery and charge tasks with minimal energy consumption. Each agent runs a decentralized protocol, running path planning and optimization algorithms. In contrast to conventional auction-based methods for task scheduling, each agent is designed to function as both the network’s auctioneer and bidder, depending on the task type. Recent works combine the auction-based algorithm with other methodologies, as seen in [[40](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B40-BDCC-08-00177),[41](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B41-BDCC-08-00177),[42](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B42-BDCC-08-00177)].

[ [38](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B38-BDCC-08-00177) ]的工作研究了无人机智能交通的第二价格拍卖算法的使用。还包括深度学习方法，以通过收入最优性增强拍卖算法的稳健性。此外，[ [39](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B39-BDCC-08-00177) ]中还讨论了无人机交付拍卖算法的改进实现。针对该应用提出了轻量级分布式任务分配，以最小的能耗简化配送和收费任务的管理。每个代理运行一个去中心化协议，运行路径规划和优化算法。与传统的基于拍卖的任务调度方法相比，每个代理都被设计为根据任务类型同时充当网络的拍卖人和投标人。最近的工作将基于拍卖的算法与其他方法相结合，如 [[40](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B41-BDCC-08-00177) [41](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B42-BDCC-08-00177) [42](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B40-BDCC-08-00177)] 中所示。

## Optimization-Based Algorithms 基于优化的算法

The optimization methodology is widely used in applied mathematics to find the optimal solution to a specific problem. The goal of the optimization is to reduce costs or maximize profit through an objective function, aiming to find the best solution from a set of possible solutions. Various constraints can be applied to optimize the cost function and achieve an improved solution. A variety of optimization techniques are evaluated, including three main groups: deterministic, metaheuristic (or stochastic), and heuristic. Methods based on deterministic optimization do not consider randomness; i.e., the output is equal when the same initial condition is adopted. Graphical methods, sequential and linear programming, and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) are some examples of deterministic techniques. Stochastic methods, on the other hand, include randomness in the algorithm, leading to different outcomes even in the presence of the same initial conditions. Evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, Monte Carlo methods, and simulated annealing are some of the current examples for this group of algorithms. Furthermore, heuristic algorithms are an interesting alternative to deterministic methods (that yield a high computational cost), providing fast solutions in good computational time. Heuristic algorithms use practical approaches and shortcuts to obtain solutions that are not necessarily optimal, but sufficient for finding good local solutions.

优化方法广泛应用于应用数学中，以寻找特定问题的最优解决方案。优化的目标是通过目标函数降低成本或最大化利润，旨在从一组可能的解决方案中找到最佳解决方案。可以应用各种约束来优化成本函数并实现改进的解决方案。评估了各种优化技术，包括三个主要组：确定性、元启发式（或随机）和启发式。基于确定性优化的方法不考虑随机性；即采用相同初始条件时，输出相等。图形方法、顺序和线性规划以及混合整数线性规划 (MILP) 是确定性技术的一些示例。另一方面，随机方法在算法中包含随机性，即使存在相同的初始条件也会导致不同的结果。进化算法、群体智能、蒙特卡罗方法和模拟退火是这组算法的一些当前示例。此外，启发式算法是确定性方法（计算成本较高）的有趣替代方案，可以在良好的计算时间内提供快速解决方案。启发式算法使用实用的方法和捷径来获得不一定是最优的解决方案，但足以找到良好的局部解决方案。

## Hybrid Allocation Algorithms 混合分配算法

Hybrid allocation strategies are also designed to improve the transportation efficiency for UAV-based ITSs by merging different types of allocation algorithms.  
混合分配策略还旨在通过合并不同类型的分配算法来提高基于无人机的智能交通系统的运输效率。

The work of [[74](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B74-BDCC-08-00177)] combines mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and a simulated annealing (SA)-based heuristic algorithm to find optimal routes for a drone delivery application. Both battery consumption and payload weight are considered to calculate the drone’s energy consumption. MILP is employed to minimize costs and the delivery time up to a budget constraint, while the SA is used to find suboptimal solutions of practical scenarios, i.e., the relation between the delivery time and budget. As a drawback, the SA algorithm fails to utilize geographical information to attenuate the choice of impractical routes. Hybrid algorithms can also be used to investigate the optimization of the service itself, as in [[75](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B75-BDCC-08-00177)]. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) are combined to minimize the number of deployed drones, cost, and flight time. The proposed algorithm incorporates different strategies, such as interval transformation, dynamic weighting rules, and a nonlinear convergence factor, to enhance the performance accuracy and to lower the cost.
[ [74](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B74-BDCC-08-00177) ]的工作结合了混合整数线性规划（MILP）和基于模拟退火（SA）的启发式算法来寻找无人机送货应用的最佳路线。计算无人机的能耗时会考虑电池消耗和有效负载重量。 MILP 用于在预算约束下最小化成本和交付时间，而 SA 用于寻找实际场景的次优解决方案，即交付时间与预算之间的关系。 SA 算法的缺点是无法利用地理信息来减少不切实际的路线的选择。混合算法也可以用于研究服务本身的优化，如[ [75](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B75-BDCC-08-00177) ]中所示。粒子群优化（PSO）和灰狼优化器（GWO）相结合，可以最大程度地减少部署的无人机数量、成本和飞行时间。该算法结合了区间变换、动态加权规则和非线性收敛因子等不同策略，以提高性能精度并降低成本。

The work of [[76](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B76-BDCC-08-00177)] combines the Hungarian algorithm (HA) and machine learning (ML) to optimize the task assignment problem in a drone delivery application. Different mathematical models, such as linear and polynomial regressions, are used to generate distinct cost functions, based on distance and time metrics. Once the cost function is estimated, the Hungarian algorithm is employed for solving the drone intelligent delivery problem. The Hungarian algorithm is defined by a matrix of costs, which represents the cost of each agent or task.

[ [76](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B76-BDCC-08-00177) ]的工作结合了匈牙利算法（HA）和机器学习（ML）来优化无人机交付应用中的任务分配问题。不同的数学模型（例如线性和多项式回归）用于根据距离和时间度量生成不同的成本函数。一旦成本函数被估计出来，匈牙利算法就被用来解决无人机智能交付问题。匈牙利算法由成本矩阵定义，该矩阵表示每个代理或任务的成本。

Similarly, the combination of a multi-agent RL algorithm and a conflict-free method is investigated in [[77](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B77-BDCC-08-00177)] to optimize task allocation and path planning for multiple drones. The strategy guarantees that the shortest path is chosen for the drones, while multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) enables collision avoidance between the drones. The work of [[78](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B78-BDCC-08-00177)] investigates the design of a rapid allocation algorithm, based on the combination of a greedy auction algorithm and a reassignment strategy. The combination of both strategies enables swift and effective responses, which result in a rapid and efficient completion of tasks while preventing the occurrence of deadlocks. In addition, neural networks are widely employed for task allocation [[79](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B79-BDCC-08-00177)]. An assisted learning invasive encroachment neutralization (ALIEN) technique is designed for a secure drone transportation system. The objective function of the ALIEN algorithm aims to maximize the security of the drone transportation system, and it is represented by $I_{max}=t_iD_i+t_iD^d_{rλ_i} +t_iD_{N_i}$, where the decision variables represent drone detection, object recognition, and neutralization, respectively.

类似地，[ [77](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B77-BDCC-08-00177) ]研究了多智能体强化学习算法和无冲突方法的结合，以优化多架无人机的任务分配和路径规划。该策略保证为无人机选择最短路径，而多智能体近端策略优化（MAPPO）可以避免无人机之间的碰撞。 [ [78](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B78-BDCC-08-00177) ]的工作研究了基于贪婪拍卖算法和重新分配策略的组合的快速分配算法的设计。两种策略的结合可以实现快速有效的响应，从而快速高效地完成任务，同时防止死锁的发生。此外，神经网络广泛用于任务分配[ [79](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B79-BDCC-08-00177) ]。辅助学习侵入性侵占中和（ALIEN）技术是为安全的无人机运输系统而设计的。 ALIEN 算法的目标函数旨在最大化无人机运输系统的安全性，其表示为 $I_{max}=t_iD_i+t_iD^d_{rλ_i} +t_iD_{N_i}$ ，其中决策变量分别代表无人机检测、物体识别和中和。

Moreover, the maximum task allocation algorithm is proposed in [[80](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B80-BDCC-08-00177)]. The maximum task allocation algorithm for multiple UAVs under time constraints has been significant in meeting requirements for quality of service. The TRMaxAlloc algorithm is designed based on two phases: assignment and reassignment. The PI algorithm is used, in the first stage, to allocate the tasks to the drones, while, in the next stage, the proposed TRMaxAlloc algorithm enables the creation of feasible time slots for the unassigned tasks. As a result, the assignment enables each task to be completed before its corresponding deadline with a lower time cost. Each UAV is assigned to several tasks, as described by the task list ${s1,s2,…,sN}$. Then, the cost function, expressed as $J=max |si|$, aims to optimize the task allocation problem.

此外，[ [80](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B80-BDCC-08-00177) ]中提出了最大任务分配算法。时间约束下多无人机最大任务分配算法对于满足服务质量要求具有重要意义。 TRMaxAlloc 算法的设计基于两个阶段：分配和重新分配。在第一阶段，使用 PI 算法将任务分配给无人机，而在下一阶段，所提出的 TRMaxAlloc 算法可以为未分配的任务创建可行的时隙。因此，分配使每个任务能够在相应的截止日期之前以较低的时间成本完成。每架无人机被分配多个任务，如任务列表所述 ${s1,s2,…,sN}$ 。那么，成本函数，表示为 $J=max |si|$ ，旨在优化任务分配问题。

A real-time market-based task allocation mechanism is proposed in [[81](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B81-BDCC-08-00177)] for a dynamic coalition formation (DCF) problem. Autonomous agents can collaborate independently, creating an optimal global coalition structure to efficiently execute the emerging tasks. The auction algorithm is used for real-time assignment, and a mutual-selection method is employed for obtaining an improved performance in terms of the agent utilization rate and task completion rate. In addition, the work of [[82](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B82-BDCC-08-00177)] investigated the combination of a distributed evolutionary algorithm and a greedy algorithm to simultaneously optimize multiple objective functions. This combined methodology aims to improve the model’s local optimizing ability with different constraints, such as spatial constraints, time costs, and energy consumption. The proposed strategy aims to efficiently solve large-scale task allocation problems with enhanced and more diverse non-dominated solutions.

[ [81](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B81-BDCC-08-00177) ]针对动态联盟形成（DCF）问题提出了一种基于市场的实时任务分配机制。自治代理可以独立协作，创建最佳的全球联盟结构，以有效地执行新兴任务。采用拍卖算法进行实时分配，并采用相互选择的方法在代理利用率和任务完成率方面获得改进的性能。此外，[ [82](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#B82-BDCC-08-00177) ]的工作研究了分布式进化算法和贪婪算法的组合来同时优化多个目标函数。这种组合方法旨在提高模型在不同约束下的局部优化能力，例如空间约束、时间成本和能量消耗。所提出的策略旨在通过增强且更多样化的非支配解决方案来有效解决大规模任务分配问题。

## Discussion

The primary objective of this paper is to serve as a state-of-the-art reference for researchers and engineers about the science of task allocation applied to various UAV-based ITSs. Such technology is foreseen to become popular in the next decades in different contexts: smart cities, urban air mobility, smart logistics, connected vehicles, etc.  
本文的主要目的是为研究人员和工程师提供有关应用于各种基于无人机的 ITS 的任务分配科学的最新参考。预计此类技术将在未来几十年在不同的环境中流行：智慧城市、城市空中交通、智能物流、互联车辆等。

The main conclusions drawn from this survey are summarized as follows:  
本次调查得出的主要结论总结如下：

- Market-based allocation algorithms are, in general, less computationally demanding than other methods, but the bidding procedure has to be designed carefully to avoid unfair allocations. Market-based allocation architectures should be developed for applications with a high level of autonomy and inherent dynamicity (e.g., parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, search and rescue, and passenger transportation), with the drones being able to adjust their bids based on their current status as well as both the service demand and the environmental conditions;

  一般来说，基于市场的分配算法比其他方法的计算要求较低，但必须仔细设计投标程序以避免不公平的分配。应为具有高度自主性和固有动态性的应用（例如包裹递送、交通监控、搜索和救援以及客运）开发基于市场的分配架构，无人机能够根据当前情况调整其出价状况以及服务需求和环境条件；

- Optimization-based approaches produce more efficient allocation but should be used to allocate tasks to UAVs in static scenarios with well-defined constraints (e.g., inspection and data collection). The main drawback is the scalability of these approaches with larger fleets due to their computational complexity. Also, complex application scenarios may be difficult to model, and discrepancies between a real application and a simulation model may severely affect the quality of the obtained solution;

  基于优化的方法可以产生更有效的分配，但应该用于在具有明确定义的约束（例如检查和数据收集）的静态场景中将任务分配给无人机。主要缺点是由于计算复杂性，这些方法在较大车队中的可扩展性。此外，复杂的应用场景可能难以建模，实际应用与仿真模型之间的差异可能会严重影响所获得解决方案的质量；

- Learning-based task allocation algorithms are suitable for highly dynamic scenarios in which the UAVs can exploit large datasets of past experiences to adapt to variable environmental conditions. A preferable application can be identified as the UAV traffic monitoring service. On the other hand, a learning-based task allocation architecture is not suitable for every type of scenario involving environmental variability; for instance, considering a critical emergency scenario such as disaster response, the trustworthiness of UAV task allocations plays a crucial role, thereby limiting the deployment of such an allocation architecture. Also, the questionable level of generalizability to unseen conditions may be a limiting factor;

  基于学习的任务分配算法适用于高度动态的场景，其中无人机可以利用过去经验的大型数据集来适应可变的环境条件。一个优选的应用是无人机交通监控服务。另一方面，基于学习的任务分配架构并不适合所有涉及环境变化的场景。例如，考虑到灾难响应等关键紧急情况，无人机任务分配的可信度起着至关重要的作用，从而限制了这种分配架构的部署。此外，对未见条件的普遍适用性值得怀疑，这可能是一个限制因素；

- Game-theory-based approaches are well suited for applications in which the UAVs can compete against one another or cooperate in the completion of a task with well-defined utilities. Coverage and traffic monitoring tasks represent a valid example since the UAVs of the ITS can compete for the best coverage/monitoring location. The limitations of a game-theory-based task allocation strategy in UAV-based ITS contexts are both the computational burden with large fleets and the capability of the utility function to adequately represent the real-world reward related to the allocation;

  基于博弈论的方法非常适合无人机可以相互竞争或与明确定义的实用程序合作完成任务的应用。覆盖和交通监控任务是一个有效的例子，因为 ITS 的无人机可以竞争最佳的覆盖/监控位置。在基于无人机的 ITS 环境中，基于博弈论的任务分配策略的局限性既在于大型机队的计算负担，又在于效用函数充分代表与分配相关的现实世界奖励的能力；

- The design of a hybrid allocation architecture incorporating multiple approaches is the most promising strategy for leveraging the characteristics of each method, thus enhancing the capability of the allocation algorithm to meet the requirements of (i) the environment, (ii) the service, and (iii) the UAV-based ITS. Also, hybrid allocation algorithms feature a higher generalization capability with respect to both the service and the robot type.

  结合多种方法的混合分配架构的设计是利用每种方法的特性的最有前途的策略，从而增强分配算法的能力以满足（i）环境、（ii）服务和（ iii) 基于无人机的智能交通系统。此外，混合分配算法对于服务和机器人类型都具有更高的泛化能力。

Finally, [Table 8](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#table_body_display_BDCC-08-00177-t008) summarizes the characteristics of the allocation methods in terms of computational cost, efficiency in finding optimal solutions, scalability to large fleets, capability of handling dynamic tasks, robots, and environments, and the most suitable application domains in the context of UAV-based ITSs.

最后，[表 8](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/12/177#table_body_display_BDCC-08-00177-t008)总结了分配方法的特征，包括计算成本、寻找最佳解决方案的效率、大型机队的可扩展性、处理动态任务、机器人和环境的能力，以及无人机背景下最合适的应用领域基于 ITS。

The use of unmanned aerial vehicles has gained significant attention in the context of intelligent transportation. The use of different sensors and high-resolution cameras enables the drones to support road transportation vehicles and to be used for a variety of parcel delivery tasks, among other applications. However, a scalable and efficient task allocation architecture must be designed for optimizing the coordination of the fleet of drones of an intelligent transportation system. Generally, task allocation is used to minimize the execution time of the tasks with a reliable and well-defined procedure. A categorization can be defined depending on the number and type of vehicles and tasks employed, including single-task UAVs or multi-task UAVs, single-UAV tasks or multi-UAV tasks, online or offline task allocation, and independent or dependent tasks. In addition, a combination of multiple UAVs and trucks as well as the inclusion of several constraints can significantly improve the overall efficiency. Therefore, the constant development of task allocation enables us to create more efficient methodologies that cover a large variety of scenarios.

在智能交通领域，无人机的使用受到了广泛关注。通过使用不同的传感器和高分辨率摄像头，无人机可以支持道路运输车辆，并可用于各种包裹递送任务以及其他应用。然而，必须设计一个可扩展且高效的任务分配架构，以优化智能交通系统无人机机队的协调。通常，任务分配用于通过可靠且定义明确的过程来最小化任务的执行时间。可以根据所使用的车辆和任务的数量和类型来定义分类，包括单任务无人机或多任务无人机、单无人机任务或多无人机任务、在线或离线任务分配以及独立或相关任务。此外，多个无人机和卡车的组合以及包含多个约束可以显着提高整体效率。因此，任务分配的不断发展使我们能够创建更有效的方法来覆盖各种场景。

In this sense, this paper provides a comprehensive literature review of how such approaches are being utilized to optimize the allocation of tasks in UAV-based ITSs. Market-based algorithms, game-theory-based algorithms, optimization-based algorithms, machine learning techniques, and other hybrid methodologies are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the main applications of unmanned aerial vehicles in ITSs are presented as well as the suitability of the task allocation algorithms presented throughout the paper with respect to the different applications. The main characteristics of, limitations of, and differences between the algorithms are highlighted, showing their main uses over the last few years. Understanding the main characteristics and the applicability of each type of allocation enables engineers and researchers to properly choose the most appropriate type of task scheduling logic. Moreover, the emerging trends and gaps in the literature are also discussed.

从这个意义上说，本文对如何利用这些方法来优化基于无人机的智能交通系统中的任务分配进行了全面的文献综述。回顾和讨论了基于市场的算法、基于博弈论的算法、基于优化的算法、机器学习技术和其他混合方法。此外，还介绍了无人机在智能交通系统中的主要应用，以及本文提出的任务分配算法对于不同应用的适用性。突出显示了算法的主要特征、局限性和差异，显示了它们在过去几年中的主要用途。了解每种分配类型的主要特征和适用性使工程师和研究人员能够正确选择最合适的任务调度逻辑类型。此外，还讨论了文献中的新兴趋势和差距。

In conclusion, we stress the importance of considering the requirements of the service as well as the environmental conditions and the operational capability of the UAV-based intelligent transportation system when designing a task allocation strategy.

总之，我们强调在设计任务分配策略时考虑服务要求以及基于无人机的智能交通系统的环境条件和运行能力的重要性。

As a further consideration, it is worth noticing that the design of communication channels and their security are fundamental for both implementing (if the allocation architecture is fully decentralized) and validating (if the allocation architecture is centralized or distributed) the allocation of tasks in a fleet of UAVs. Also, the security of the communication channels is a significant challenge for achieving a safe, regulatory-compliant, and resilient real-world deployment of a UAV-based ITS. The efficiency of the task allocation process can be heavily influenced by aspects such as the security of the communication channels as well as their fallibility.

作为进一步的考虑，值得注意的是，通信通道的设计及其安全性对于实现（如果分配架构是完全去中心化的）和验证（如果分配架构是集中式的还是分布式的）任务分配至关重要。无人机机队。此外，通信通道的安全性是实现基于无人机的 ITS 的安全、合规和弹性现实部署的重大挑战。任务分配过程的效率可能会受到通信通道的安全性及其可靠性等方面的严重影响。

Future survey-based research will focus on investigating how the UAV communication protocol can influence the efficiency of the task allocation architecture in terms of both security and robustness to fallible communication networks. Also, conceptual modelling frameworks used to implement task allocation algorithms in UAV-based ITSs may also be discussed.

未来基于调查的研究将重点调查无人机通信协议如何影响任务分配架构的效率，包括安全性和对易出错通信网络的鲁棒性。此外，还可以讨论用于在基于无人机的 ITS 中实现任务分配算法的概念建模框架。

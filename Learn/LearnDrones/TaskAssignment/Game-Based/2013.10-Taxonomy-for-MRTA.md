Abstract
Task allocation is an important aspect of many multi-robot systems. The features and complexity of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problems are dictated by the requirements of the particular domain under consideration. These problems can range from those involving instantaneous distribution of simple, independent tasks among members of a homogenous team, to those requiring the time-extended scheduling of complex interrelated multi-step tasks for members of a heterogenous team related by several constraints. The existing widely used taxonomy for task allocation in multi-robot systems was designed for problems with independent tasks and does not deal with problems with interrelated utilities and constraints. While that taxonomy was a ground-breaking contribution to the MRTA literature, a survey of recent work in MRTA reveals that it is no longer a sufficient taxonomy, due to the increasing importance of interrelated utilities and constraints in realistic MRTA problems under consideration. Thus, in this paper, we present a new, comprehensive taxonomy, iTax, that explicitly takes into consideration the issues of interrelated utilities and constraints. Our taxonomy maps categories of MRTA problems to existing mathematical models from combinatorial optimization and operations research, and hence draws important parallels between robotics and these fields.

任务分配是多机器人系统中的一个重要方面。多机器人任务分配（MRTA）问题的特征和复杂性由所考虑特定领域的需求决定。这些问题可能涉及同构团队成员之间简单、独立任务的即时分配，也可能需要为受多重约束关联的异构团队成员制定时间扩展型的复杂、相互关联多步骤任务调度。现有广泛使用的多机器人系统任务分配分类法是针对独立任务问题设计的，无法处理具有相互关联效用和约束的问题。虽然该分类法对 MRTA 研究领域作出了开创性贡献，但通过对近期 MRTA 工作的调研发现，由于实际 MRTA 问题中相互关联效用与约束的重要性日益凸显，现有分类法已不再完备。因此，本文提出了一种新的综合性分类法 iTax，该分类法明确考虑了相互关联效用与约束问题。 我们的分类法将多机器人任务分配（MRTA）问题的类别映射到组合优化与运筹学领域的现有数学模型，由此在机器人学与这些学科领域之间建立了重要的理论关联。

## Abstract:

In this paper, we study the multi-task cooperation problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, where the UAV energy consumption is taken into consideration during location scheduling and task implementation. One task may need the cooperation of several UAVs with specific capabilities. To avoid unreasonable task allocation, we quantify the mission properties of UAVs and task areas. We comprehensively consider the overlapping and complementary relationship of the UAV's task types, so that UAVs can form corresponding collective execution tasks according to the task attributes. Based on the coalition game theory, we model the distributed task assignment problem of UAVs as a coalition formation game (CFG). We propose a task allocation algorithm, and then prove that it can achieve the joint optimization of energy and task completion by decision-making of UAVs in finite iterations. With the equilibrium properties of coalition formation in UAV networks, we further optimize the position of UAVs to minimize the network energy consumption. Simulation results verify that the proposed method can reduce the flight loss with high task completion degree.

在本文中，我们研究了无人机 （UAV） 集群的多任务协作问题，其中在位置调度和任务实施过程中考虑了无人机能耗。一项任务可能需要几架具有特定能力的无人机的合作。为避免不合理的任务分配，我们对无人机和任务区的任务属性进行了量化。我们综合考虑了无人机任务类型的重叠和互补关系，使无人机能够根据任务属性形成相应的集体执行任务。基于联盟博弈论，我们将无人机的分布式任务分配问题建模为联盟形成博弈 （CFG）。我们提出了一种任务分配算法，进而证明它可以通过无人机的有限迭代决策来实现能量的联合优化和任务完成。利用无人机网络中联盟形成的均衡特性，我们进一步优化了无人机的位置，以最大限度地降低网络能耗。仿真结果验证了所提方法能够在任务完成度高的情况下降低飞行损失。

## Introduction

Therefore, we propose an **energy-efficient task cooperation scheme for heterogeneous multi-UAV** in view of cooperative task assignment and energy optimization of heterogeneous UAVs.

- Firstly, a **task relationship model** is proposed to quantify the task attribute of ground task areas, the capabilities of UAVs in terms of task types they can run, in order to define a general satisfaction function to quantify the task completion degree.
- Then, the **energy consumption model** is proposed to account for the energy loss during flight and hovering stages.

因此，从异构无人机协同任务分配和能量优化的角度，我们提出一种**异构多无人机节能任务协作方案**。首先，提出**任务关系模型**来量化地面任务区域的任务属性、无人机可运行的任务类型的能力，从而定义通用的满意度函数来量化任务完成程度。然后，提出了**能量消耗模型**来解释飞行和悬停阶段的能量损失。

To achieve automatic and self-organizing task cooperation with energy constraints, we establish a distributed task assignment model for UAVs based on the coalition formation game (CFG) [14]–​[17]. Aiming at characteristics of cooperation and complementary relationships among UAVs brought by location and mission attributes, we develop the coalition formation game with the peer effects among UAVs [18]–​[20]. We propose the coalition formation algorithm based on cooperation rule, where coalition merge rules and coalition split rules are designed. Moreover, we prove the convergence of the algorithm based on the potential game theory [21]–​[23]. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

为了实现能量约束下的自动自组织任务协作，建立了基于联盟形成博弈（CFG）的无人机分布式任务分配模型 [14] –​ [17] 。针对位置和任务属性带来的无人机间合作和互补关系的特点，开发了无人机间同伴效应的联盟形成博弈 [18] –​ [20] 。我们提出了基于合作规则的联盟形成算法，设计了联盟合并规则和联盟分裂规则。并基于势博弈理论证明了算法的收敛性 [21] –​ [23] 。本文的贡献总结如下：

- We study the problem of UAV assignment in multi-UAV and multi-task scenario. The UAVs’ task types, energy loss and the time of performing tasks are considered to improve the task completion degree in the task area while reducing the energy loss of UAVs.
- 我们研究多无人机、多任务场景下的无人机分配问题。综合考虑无人机的任务类型、能量损耗以及执行任务的时间，在降低无人机能量损耗的同时，提高任务区域的任务完成度。

The overlapping and complementary relationships of UAVs’ tasks are considered, which can reduce the energy loss of the UAVs and improve the task completion degree in the task area.

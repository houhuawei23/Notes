## Abstract

Reasonable and effective task allocation strategy is the premise to ensure the successful completion of combat missions, which is of great significance to improve the overall operational effectiveness of the cluster. In this paper, a cooperative task allocation method for multi heterogeneous aerial vehicles under strong space-time constraints using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and entropy weight method is presented. Specifically, the problem of cooperative task allocation is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem under multi-constraint conditions, and the requirement of required time of arrival (RTA) of time-sensitive targets is considered. Then, the PSO algorithm is applied to solve the task allocation model. Especially, task sequence is introduced into the coding of the feasible solutions, and task urgency is employed to update the particle position. Furthermore, the entropy weight method is introduced into task assignment scheme decision-making. Finally, a simulation is given to illustrate the validity.

合理有效的任务分配策略是保证作战任务顺利完成的前提，对提高集群整体作战效能具有重要意义。本文提出一种基于粒子群优化(Particle Swarm Optimization，PSO)算法和熵权法的强时空约束下多异构无人机协同任务分配方法。具体而言，将协同任务分配问题建模为多约束条件下的多目标优化问题，并考虑时敏目标的到达时间要求(Required Time of Arrival，RTA)；进而应用 PSO 算法求解任务分配模型，特别地将任务序列引入可行解的编码，并利用任务紧迫度更新粒子位置；此外，将熵权法引入任务分配方案决策过程。最后通过仿真验证了所提方法的有效性。

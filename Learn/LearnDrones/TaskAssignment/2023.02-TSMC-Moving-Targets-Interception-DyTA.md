Abstract:

This article addresses the dynamic task allocation problem with limited communication and velocity. The main challenge lie in the selection of k fittest winner participants and the participant contention that one winner participant may be selected by multiple targets simultaneously. Existing methods take the distance between the targets and participants as the evaluation index to select winners, which may lead to futile selection since the winner participant locating at the opposite direction of the target cannot intercept the target with limited velocity. By carefully considering both the distance between the targets and participants and the motion direction of the targets, an improved evaluation index for each target is proposed and employed such that the futile selection can be avoided in the executing process of the algorithm. Moreover, an extra evaluation index for each winner participant is presented to select one winner target to overcome the participant contention. Based on these, the control protocols are developed for targets interception, and their stability is proven by the Lyapunov theory under some suitable conditions. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithms.

本文研究了通信与速度受限条件下的动态任务分配问题。核心挑战在于如何选择 k 最优胜出执行体以及解决同一执行体可能被多目标同时选择的执行体竞争问题。现有方法以目标与执行体间距离为评价指标进行胜出者选择，但由于速度受限时位于目标运动反方向的胜出执行体无法有效拦截目标，可能导致无效选择。通过综合考虑目标与执行体间距离及目标运动方向，本文提出并采用改进的评价指标，可有效避免算法执行过程中的无效选择。此外，针对执行体竞争问题，提出胜出执行体对候选目标的额外评价指标以实现唯一目标选择。基于上述方法设计了目标拦截控制协议，并在适当条件下通过 Lyapunov 理论证明了系统的稳定性。 最后，通过仿真算例验证了所提算法的有效性和优势。

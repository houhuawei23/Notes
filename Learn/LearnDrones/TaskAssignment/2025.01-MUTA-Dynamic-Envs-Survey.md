Abstract 摘要

The rapid advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has transformed a wide range of applications, including military operations, disaster response, agricultural monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. Deploying multiple UAVs to work collaboratively offers significant advantages in terms of enhanced coverage, redundancy, and operational efficiency. However, as UAV missions become more complex and operate in dynamic environments, the task assignment problem becomes increasingly challenging. Multi-UAV dynamic task assignment is critical for optimizing mission success. It involves allocating tasks to UAVs in real-time while adapting to unpredictable changes, such as sudden task appearances, UAV failures, and varying mission requirements. A key contribution of this article is that it provides a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art solutions for dynamic task assignment in multi-UAV systems from 2013 to 2024. It also introduces a comparative framework to evaluate algorithms based on metrics such as responsiveness, robustness, and scalability in handling real-world dynamic conditions. Our analysis reveals distinct strengths and limitations across three major approaches: market-based, intelligent optimization, and clustering-based solutions. Market-based solutions excel in distributed coordination and real-time adaptability, but face challenges with communication overhead. Intelligent optimization solutions, including evolutionary and swarm intelligence, provide high flexibility and performance in complex scenarios but require significant computational resources. Clustering-based solutions efficiently group and allocate tasks geographically, reducing overlap and improving efficiency, although they struggle with adaptability in dynamic environments. By identifying these strengths, limitations, and emerging trends, this article not only offers a detailed comparative analysis but also highlights critical research gaps. Specifically, it underscores the need for scalable algorithms that can efficiently handle larger UAV fleets, robust methods to adapt to sudden task changes and UAV failures, and multi-objective optimization frameworks to balance competing goals such as energy efficiency and task completion. These insights serve as a guide for future research and a valuable resource for developing resilient and efficient strategies for multi-UAV dynamic task assignment in complex environments.

无人机（UAV）的快速发展已经改变了包括军事行动、灾害响应、农业监测和基础设施检查在内的广泛应用。部署多个无人机协同工作提供了增强覆盖范围、冗余和运营效率的显著优势。然而，随着无人机任务变得更加复杂并在动态环境中运行，任务分配问题变得越来越具有挑战性。多无人机动态任务分配对于优化任务成功至关重要。它涉及在实时分配任务的同时适应不可预测的变化，如突然出现任务、无人机故障和不断变化的任务需求。本文的一个关键贡献是，它提供了对 2013 年至 2024 年间多无人机系统中动态任务分配最先进解决方案的全面研究。它还介绍了一个比较框架，用于根据响应性、鲁棒性和可扩展性等指标评估算法在处理现实世界动态条件下的性能。 我们的分析揭示了三种主要方法（基于市场的、智能优化和基于聚类的解决方案）在优势和局限性方面的差异：基于市场的解决方案在分布式协调和实时适应性方面表现出色，但面临通信开销的挑战。包括进化算法和群体智能在内的智能优化解决方案在复杂场景中提供高灵活性和性能，但需要大量的计算资源。基于聚类的解决方案有效地按地理区域分组和分配任务，减少了重叠并提高了效率，尽管它们在动态环境中适应性较差。通过识别这些优势和局限性以及新兴趋势，本文不仅提供了详细的比较分析，还突出了关键的研究空白。具体来说，它强调了需要可扩展的算法，这些算法可以有效地处理更大的无人机机队，需要适应突然的任务变化和无人机故障的稳健方法，以及多目标优化框架，以平衡如能源效率和任务完成等竞争目标。 这些见解为未来的研究提供了指导，并为在复杂环境中开发具有弹性和高效的多无人机动态任务分配策略提供了宝贵资源。

1. Introduction  1. 简介
The deployment of a group of robots in a cooperative manner to accomplish a set of tasks is a key topic of research in the robotics domain [1,2,3]. Such groups of robots, known as multi-robot systems (MRSs), take advantage of the cooperative behaviors of robots to make feasible and attainable complicated tasks that are too time-consuming and exhausting for a single robot [2,4]. One of the most challenging problems in MRSs is the multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem. It concerns how to optimally assign a set of robots to a set of tasks in a way that optimizes predefined objectives and overall performance while considering a set of constraints [5].
机器人以协作方式部署以完成一系列任务是机器人领域研究的关键主题[1, 2, 3]。这类机器人群体，被称为多机器人系统（MRSs），利用机器人的协作行为，使复杂任务变得可行和可达成，这些任务对于单个机器人来说耗时且费力[2, 4]。多机器人系统中最具挑战性的问题之一是多机器人任务分配（MRTA）问题。它涉及如何以最优方式将一组机器人分配给一组任务，从而在考虑一系列约束条件的同时优化预定义的目标和整体性能[5]。
The evolution and deployment of UAV technology in autonomous intelligent systems is one of the most crucial developments in the 21st century so far and has gained substantial attention in scientific research [6]. It has also significantly impacted a wide range of industries, including reconnaissance [7], disaster management [8], communication assistance [9], surveillance [10], and autonomous exploration [11]. Compared with a single-UAV system that has limited capabilities, multi-UAV systems, which involve the collaboration of multiple UAVs to complete intricate missions, have received widespread interest because of the advantages they offer, which include the following: collaboration and the distribution of workload among UAVs, the availability of different UAV capabilities, being more fault-tolerant to a single-point failure, and being more scalable in handling large problems [12,13]. Because of these advantages, multi-UAV systems are usually adopted to accomplish sophisticated tasks in complex environments. The multi-UAV task assignment problem is an instance of an MRTA problem that can be defined as a set of UAVs capable of performing a set of tasks in which the objective is to find an optimum assignment between UAVs and tasks while satisfying the requirements of predefined constraints [14,15,16,17]. The multi-UAV task assignment problem can be divided into two types according to the certainty of the environment: static or dynamic. Static task assignment assumes that the number of UAVs and tasks is fixed and that their status and location are known before allocation starts. In dynamic task assignment, the environment is constantly changing; new tasks may suddenly emerge during allocation, or one of the existing UAVs may fail to complete its mission [7]. The unpredictability of these environments requires algorithms that can rapidly adapt to changes, reassign tasks, and ensure mission success even when facing disruptions. This complexity is further compounded by the need to optimize resource allocation while managing communication constraints, ensuring system robustness, and maintaining the overall efficiency of the UAV fleet. This makes the problem of dynamic task assignment technically challenging and critical to the successful deployment of multi-UAV systems in real-world scenarios [18]. Such a problem is a combinatorial optimization problem known to be an NP-hard problem and obtaining a globally optimal solution becomes increasingly computationally extensive as the problem size increases [7,19].
无人机技术在自主智能系统中的演变和部署是迄今为止 21 世纪最重要的进展之一，在科学研究领域受到了广泛关注[6]。它还对包括侦察[7]、灾害管理[8]、通信辅助[9]、监控[10]和自主探索[11]在内的众多行业产生了重大影响。与功能有限的单一无人机系统相比，多无人机系统，即多个无人机协作完成复杂任务，因其提供的优势而受到广泛关注，包括以下方面：无人机之间的协作和任务分配、不同无人机能力的可用性、对单点故障的容错性更强，以及处理大规模问题的可扩展性更强[12, 13]。由于这些优势，多无人机系统通常被用于在复杂环境中完成复杂任务。 多无人机任务分配问题是一种多机器人任务分配（MRTA）问题的实例，可以定义为能够执行一组任务的一组无人机，其目标是找到无人机和任务之间的最优分配，同时满足预定义约束的要求[14, 15, 16, 17]。根据环境的确定性，多无人机任务分配问题可以分为两种类型：静态或动态。静态任务分配假设无人机和任务的数量是固定的，并且在分配开始之前它们的状况和位置是已知的。在动态任务分配中，环境不断变化；在分配过程中可能会突然出现新的任务，或者现有的无人机可能无法完成其任务[7]。这些环境的不可预测性要求算法能够快速适应变化，重新分配任务，并在面对干扰时确保任务成功。这种复杂性进一步加剧了优化资源分配的需求，同时管理通信约束，确保系统鲁棒性，并保持无人机机队的整体效率。 这使动态任务分配问题在技术上具有挑战性，对于多无人机系统在实际场景中的成功部署至关重要[ 18]。此类问题是一个已知的 NP 难组合优化问题，随着问题规模的增加，获得全局最优解的计算量越来越大[ 7, 19]。

Strengths of this review article compared to previous works: This article provides a more focused and comprehensive analysis of the multi-UAV task assignment problem specifically in dynamic environments, which distinguishes it from previous surveys in several key areas. Unlike earlier works, which have generally addressed multi-robot systems (MRSs) or multi-UAV systems without focusing specifically on dynamic task assignment, this review article targets the unique challenges posed by dynamic environments in which tasks and conditions can change unpredictably.
与先前工作相比，本综述文章的优势：本文对多无人机任务分配问题进行了更专注和全面的分析，特别是在动态环境中，这在几个关键领域将本文与先前综述区分开来。与先前工作不同，先前工作通常针对多机器人系统（MRS）或多无人机系统，但没有专注于动态任务分配，本综述文章针对动态环境中任务和条件可能不可预测变化所提出的独特挑战。
The detailed exploration of these dynamic settings is a critical contribution, as it delves into how various task assignment algorithms are designed to handle unexpected events, such as the sudden appearance of new tasks, UAV failures, or changes in mission parameters—areas that have been under-explored in prior research. Moreover, it provides a thorough classification and analysis of solutions used for dynamic task assignments, including market-based, intelligent optimization-based, and clustering algorithms.

Another significant strength of this review article is its focus on dynamic task reallocation, highlighting how different algorithms manage the need for constant reassignment and re-prioritization of tasks after detecting dynamic events. This aspect is critical for maintaining operational robustness in dynamic environments and is often underrepresented in other studies. Furthermore, this work includes an extensive comparative analysis of algorithms under different dynamic conditions, offering valuable insights into their performance and trade-offs, thus helping researchers and practitioners make informed decisions when selecting or developing task assignment strategies.
这篇文章的另一大显著优势是它关注动态任务重新分配，突出了不同算法在检测到动态事件后如何管理任务不断重新分配和重新排序的需求。这一方面对于在动态环境中保持操作稳健性至关重要，在其它研究中往往被忽视。此外，这项工作对不同动态条件下的算法进行了广泛的比较分析，提供了关于它们性能和权衡的宝贵见解，从而帮助研究人员和从业者在选择或开发任务分配策略时做出明智的决定。
This work also identifies emerging trends and research gaps, providing a forward-looking perspective that encourages innovation and guides future research efforts to address current limitations. It discusses multi-objective optimization in dynamic task assignments, balancing competing goals, such as minimizing energy consumption and maximizing task coverage—another area where previous surveys fall short. Finally, the discussion of the robustness and scalability of algorithms in dynamic settings provides crucial insights into their suitability for real-world applications, making this review a comprehensive resource for advancing research and practice in multi-UAV dynamic task assignment.
这项工作还确定了新兴趋势和研究空白，提供了一个前瞻性的视角，鼓励创新并指导未来的研究努力解决当前的限制。它讨论了动态任务分配中的多目标优化，平衡相互竞争的目标，如最小化能耗和最大化任务覆盖——这是先前调查不足的另一个领域。最后，关于动态环境中算法的鲁棒性和可扩展性的讨论，为它们在现实世界应用中的适用性提供了关键见解，使这篇综述成为推进多无人机动态任务分配研究和实践的综合资源。

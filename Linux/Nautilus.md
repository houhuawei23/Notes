5. Enable quick file preview
Quick preview is rather a handy feature for a file manager. KDEâ€™s Dolphin file manager provides it as a built-in feature.

You can preview files such as PDF, text, images, audio, etc. You can scroll documents while in preview.

In Nautilus, you need to install gnome-sushi to get this feature.

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-sushi
```
Now, close all instances of file manager and open it again. To see the preview, select a file and press the Space key.
